# Generative AI

This repository explores Generative AI, a branch of artificial intelligence that focuses on creating new content, such as text, images, music, and more. By leveraging advanced machine learning models like transformers and diffusion models, generative AI can produce human-like outputs from minimal input.

## Key Functions:
__Text Generation__: Crafting coherent and contextually appropriate text for various use cases, including creative writing, summarisation, and code generation.<br/>
__Image Generation__: Creating visually compelling images from textual descriptions. <br/>
__Creative Assistance__: Providing inspiration and support for artistic and design projects. <br/>

This repository includes examples, tools, and resources to dive into generative AI and its applications.
